Gypsum is a fire-resistant, soundproof mineral sulfate-soft and is frequently utilized since it gives strength and fire and noise resistance. Gypsum work is widely utilized in decoration and ornamentation, as well as drywall cement, and is a common material yet a contemporary technique for primary construction. Natural gypsum is a dihydrate of calcium sulfurates with the chemical composition CaSO₄·2H₂O.

It possesses the added benefit of being fast to set, easy to apply, and overall use in any building. Gypsum plaster and cement plaster are both used extensively for wall finishes but differ in properties that make them unique for various uses. Cement plaster, a mixture of cement, sand, and water, is resistant to water and is strong and, therefore, used on outer surfaces or moisture-sprayed surfaces. On the other hand, gypsum plaster, made up of gypsum, is softer and must be applied to inner walls.

Gypsum is thus a fundamental building material to be utilized in areas where there is a need for sound control and sound quality. Acoustic panels constructed from gypsum and gypsum board are used in domestic, commercial, and industrial buildings to prevent noise in noise prevention transmission and improvement of acoustic quality. They are used to absorb, stop, or diffuse sound waves with the aim of reducing noise pollution and producing a more comfortable indoor environment.

It is also incredibly light, thus cost-effective for person-hours and is a pure enjoyment to install.
